# Tasks

## Task 0
### Output to standard output the message "Zdr FMI!"

## Task 1 - Geometry
### To find the face and perimeter of a rectangle with sides 10 cm and 3 cm long

**Sample output:** Perimeter = 26, Area = 30

### To find the face and perimeter of a triangle with sides 11 cm and 17 cm and 8 cm

**Sample output:** Perimeter = 36, Area = 35.5

## Task 2 - Number swap
### Enter two integers and swap their values ​​(you can try without a third variable :) )

**Sample output with numbers 10 and 15 entered:** 15 10

## Task 3 - Bigger number
### Enter two integers and output to the console the larger of the two (without if else checking as it has not been learned yet :) )

**Sample output with numbers 10 and 15 entered:** 15 10

## Task 4 - Three-digit numbers
### To enter a three-digit number, then output its three digits and their sum to standard output.

**Sample output for the number 875 :** 8 7 5 -> 20

## Task 5 - Turtles
### Write a program that calculates the cost needed to buy turtle food. Food is bought mainly for turtles, from a pet store, but sometimes the owner also buys it for his neighbor's cats. One package of food for the turtles is priced at BGN 2.50, and each other, which is not for them, costs BGN 4.

**Sample output at input 5 4 :** 28.50 lv.

**Sample output at input 0 4 :** 16 lv.

**Sample output at input 1 0 :** 2.50 lv.

* After solving the task, insert a 3rd variable that determines if it's Happy Hour, i.e. if **it** is Happy Hour, to display the final 30% cheaper

## Task 6 - From Celsius to Fahrenheit and back
### Write a program that accepts a number that will be temperature and in the first case we assume that it should be converted from Celsius to Fahrenheit, and in the second from Fahrenheit to Celsius (You can check how this conversion is done on Google :) )

**Sample output at input 0 :** From C to F -> 32.00 F, From F to C -> -17.777 C.

**Sample output at input 15 :** From C to F -> 59.00 F, From F to C -> -9.44 C.

**Sample output at input 32 :** From C to F -> 89.60 F, From F to C -> 0 C.

## Task 7 - Creeper
### Write a program that calculates the volume of a creeper from the game "Minecraft" given a user input x. We know that a creeper's head is a cube with side x, its body is a parallelepiped with sides x, x/2, and 2x, and its front and back legs are with sides x, x/2, and 3x/4.
**Clarification** - we consider its front two legs as one parallelepiped and the back two as well.

**Sample output at input 3 :** The creeper's volume is 74.25

**Sample output on input 4 :** The creeper's volume is 176

**Sample output at input 10 :** The creeper's volume is 2750
